# Billed project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

Unfortunately for Billed, Garance, a colleague on the expense report feature team, left the company before completing the application. In a fortnight, the team must show the solution that works to the whole company. Matthieu, Lead Developer of the feature team, asked for help to meet the deadline and you learned yesterday at the team meeting that you have been chosen!

### My role

You are a front-end developer at Billed, a company that produces Saas solutions for human resources teams.

In this project I was given two repo for front and back end, one document with what's left to do and some bug reports.

I had to debug and test the app, I had to do some unit and end to end test, I got to use jest to get the test coverage and I used the DevTools to find bug in the app and fix them.
